The Problem i am having with Nakama.

I have a simple project to understand Nakama system so i made a hit heal game if you are network server when you click hit in right side you should see right of the
screens player 2 health must have gone by minus fifty it works in localhost game but in nakama server i am having an issue. so when i press the hit button it only works
in my screen in rpc call it does not change in other screen. But in the other system godots networkedmultiplayerenet it works.
